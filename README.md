# London Bike Rides Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing bike rides in London from 01/04/2015 to 01/03/2017 to understand usage patterns and trends. The data is preprocessed using Python and visualized using Tableau, resulting in an interactive dashboard that provides detailed insights.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Tableau

## Data Preprocessing
The raw data is preprocessed using a Jupyter Notebook. The preprocessing steps include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and performing transformations to prepare it for visualization.
- [data_preprocessing.ipynb](data_preprocessing.ipynb)

## Tableau Dashboard
The final visualization is created using Tableau and includes several key insights into bike usage patterns, weather impacts, and temporal trends.

## Findings
- **Total Bike Rides:** Visualizes the overall bike ride activity, showing peak usage periods.
- **Moving Average Trends:** Provides insight into bike ride trends over different periods using dynamic moving averages.
- **Temperature vs. Wind Speed:** Displays the relationship between weather conditions and bike usage with a heat map.
- **Weather and Hour Insights:** Detailed analysis of bike rides segmented by weather conditions and time of day.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook and run all cells to preprocess the data.
3. Open the Tableau workbook `london_bike_rides.twbx` to view the dashboard.
